# Intelligent Fan Control System Architecture

## 1. Sensor Data Acquisition:
- **DHT11 and BMP280 Sensors:** These digital sensors collect environmental data such as temperature (DHT11: -40째C to 80째C, BMP280: -40째C to 85째C), humidity (DHT11: 20% to 90% RH), and barometric pressure (BMP280: 300 to 1100 hPa).
- **RTOS (Real-Time Operating System):** Employed for precise and timely sensor data collection, ensuring data integrity and synchronization.

## 2. Data Transmission to ESP32:
- **UART Protocol:** Data from DHT11 and BMP280 sensors transmitted simultaneously to ESP32 using Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter protocol, ensuring reliable communication at baud rates (DHT11: 9600 bps, BMP280: 115200 bps).

## 3. ESP32 Microcontroller:
- Acts as a central hub receiving sensor data through UART.
- **Data Processing:** ESP32 processes incoming data, performs preprocessing (e.g., data normalization), and prepares it for transmission over WiFi.
- **WiFi Connectivity:** Utilizes IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless communication, ensuring secure and efficient data transmission.

## 4. WiFi Communication and Computational Unit:
- **WiFi Sockets:** Sensor data sent over WiFi using TCP/IP or UDP protocols, ensuring reliable and efficient communication.
- **Computational Unit:** Receives sensor data and feeds it into a machine-learning model.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes algorithms such as regression or neural networks to analyze input data and predict optimal fan speed based on temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
- **Fan Speed Prediction:** Outputs predicted fan speed (e.g., PWM duty cycle) within predefined ranges.

## 5. Feedback to ESP32:
- Predicted fan speed transmitted back to ESP32 over WiFi connection using established communication protocols.

## 6. Fan Speed Control:
- **Motor Driver:** ESP32 communicates with motor driver using protocols such as PWM or I2C to control fan speed.
- **Output to Fan:** Motor driver adjusts power supplied to fan motor (e.g., brushless DC motor) based on predictions from the machine learning model, ensuring smooth and precise fan speed regulation.

## 7. Intelligent Fan Control Loop:
- Operates in a closed-loop fashion, continuously collecting sensor data, transmitting it to the computational unit, receiving fan speed predictions, and adjusting fan speed accordingly to maintain desired environmental conditions.
